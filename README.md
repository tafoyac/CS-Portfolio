Module Eight Journal

1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was about creating an item tracking system for a grocery store using C++. The goal was to read a list of items from a file, count how many times each item appeared, and allow the user to search for item frequencies, print a list, or generate a histogram.

2. What did you do particularly well?
I think I did a good job breaking the program into functions and keeping the code organized. The menu system worked well and made it easy to interact with.

3. Where could you enhance your code?
I could make my code more efficient by using more error handling, like checking if files open properly or if user input is valid. This would make the program more secure and less likely to crash.

4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this?
Reading the input file and storing the data correctly in a map was the hardest part. I fixed this by looking at examples online, reading documentation, and asking for help when I got stuck.

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
This project helped me get better at using C++ syntax, working with files, and using data structures like maps. These are useful for any coding class or job that involves data or user input.

6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I used clear function names, added comments to explain parts of the code, and made sure the code was spaced out and not too messy. That way, I or someone else can come back and understand it later.
